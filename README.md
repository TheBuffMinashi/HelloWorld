Hi, I'm Mina. A MATLAB Python programmer who loves to build real-world applications of AI using her programming skills. 
I've been working as a programmer for over three years mostly as freelancer.
Right now, I'm trying to start a career as a data analyst, thus, there's a lot to learn.
I'd love to spend my time working on high-tech projects to make the world a better place to live.
This is my first github repository and I'm really excited about it.
Happy coding everybody.
